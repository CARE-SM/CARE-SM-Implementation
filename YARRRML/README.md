## YARRRML template:

The YARRRML is a crutial component in the execution of the Clinical and Registry Entries (CARE) implementation workflow. However, creating and editing the required RDF templates can be a complex endeavor, primarily due to their intricate structure and vertical layout, essential for establishing a comprehensive model.

We facilitate an already functional and updated YARRRML template at this folder. This template is maintained by the CARE-SM team, so it's updated everytime the semantic model suffers any change. 

## YARRRML template builder
To address this challenge, a YARRRML builder tool called [EMbuilder](https://github.com/pabloalarconm/EMbuilder) has been developed. EMbuilder, it's a Python module and simplifies the creation and modification of YARRRML templates. By allowing precise definition of each triplet and configuration-related parameters, this tool enables the generation of fully functional YARRRML template, alleviating the burden associated with their manual creation.
