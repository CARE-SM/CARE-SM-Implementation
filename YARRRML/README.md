## YARRRML template:

The YARRRML is a crutial component in the execution of the Clinical and Registry Entries (CARE) implementation workflow. However, creating and editing the required RDF templates can be a complex endeavor, primarily due to their intricate structure and vertical layout, essential for establishing a comprehensive model.

We facilitate an already functional and updated YARRRML template at this folder. This template is maintained by the CARE-SM team, so it's updated everytime the semantic model suffers any change.
