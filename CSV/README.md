# CSV Exemplar Data

This repository includes exemplar patient data in CSV format, located in the `/data` directory. These files are fully compatible with the CARE-SM model and can be used directly with the CARE-SM Toolkit.

The content of the folder includes:

1. Individual CSV data element samples ready to be used with the CARE-SM Toolkit.

    * [Biobank](data/Biobank.csv)
    * [Birthdate](data/Birthdate.csv)
    * [Birthyear](data/Birthyear.csv)
    * [Examination](data/Examination.csv)
    * [Deathdate](data/Deathdate.csv)
    * [Diagnosis](data/Diagnosis.csv)
    * [Disability](data/Disability.csv)
    * [First confirmed visit](data/First_visit.csv)
    * [Genetic assessment](data/Genetic.csv)
    * [Laboratory measurement](data/Laboratory.csv)
    * [Medication](data/Medication.csv)
    * [Phenotype / Symptom](data/Phenotype.csv)
    * [Sex at birth](data/Sex.csv)
    * [Participation status](data/Status.csv)
    * [Surgical interventions](data/Surgery.csv)
    * [Symptoms onset](data/Symptoms_onset.csv)

    > **Note:** These files **are named using the correct tag name**, so the Toolkit can recognize the files, as described in the [CSV template guide documentation](https://care-sm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html#csv-template-creation). In addition, they contain longitudinal information related to the clinical visits during which these data elements were obtained.

2. CSV that combines several of these data elements is available:

    * [One-of-each data element in the same file](data/preCARE.csv)

    > **Note:** If you intend to use this CSV with the Toolkit, please rename the file to one of the allowed filenames (i.e., matching the tag name), as described in the [CSV template guide documentation](https://care-sm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html#csv-template-creation).

3. Resulting CSV file generated by the Toolkit containing the data from the previous individual data element **after the CSV transformation**. Ready to be transformed into RDF.

    * [Curated data element table](data/CARE.csv)
