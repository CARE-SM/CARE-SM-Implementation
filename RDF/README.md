# Exemplar N-Quad Data

---

This repository contains exemplar RDF data generated by the FAIR-in-a-box or Standalone implementation. The RDF data is organized by individual data elements.

Each file represents a single data element, including:
* Clinical results (demographics, measurements, observations)
* Longitudinal patient information (Temporal and event-related descriptions)

**Considerations:** Our implementation generates the entire core structure of the model, regardless of whether all values associated with the nodes are present. For example, an SIO-based structure for an attribute node in a laboratory measurement representation is created even when the attribute is not required for this representation. In such cases, this node will be left without any OBO Foundry-related ontological term.
